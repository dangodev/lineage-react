The uniqueness coming from this country was so surprising.  Every single coffee was so unique but on these community lots we would see such a trend of this underlying theme of chocolate, toffee and a very pleasant acidity that was sweet and soft.  We are proud to present the next chapter of our 431 from Mexico.",

Fresh Cherry arrives daily and is immediately put through disc pulpers and pumped into large concrete washing tanks.  The cleanliness of these tanks will ultimately determine the cleanliness of the coffee.  The depulped mucilage coffee is put into these tanks with water for up to 48 hours where fermentation of the sugars begins to break down the pectin of the fruit.  Following the 48 hour soak, the drain at the bottom of these tanks is released, allowing the water and cherry to flow into large washing channels where it can be scrubbed clean, removing all sticky mucilage.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe last step of the processing is to dry the coffee on raised beds for a minimum of 8 days before being sent to the dry mill to remove parchment and separate according to size and quality of the coffee.

This coffee immediately struck me as wildly different simply because of the size beans.  When we receive a sample of coffee, the first step is to measure the moisture, volatility through water activity and lastly the density of beans by just taking a 5 gram sample and seeing how many beans it takes to equal these five grams.  This helps to give an indication to how long the development of the coffee should need to be in order to fully develop sugars and yet allow balance of pleasant acids in the cup.  \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLighter mouthfeel with tight citric acidity and aromatic florals make this Kochere a coffee we are proud to offer. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e",

The somewhat undeveloped heirloom varietals are known to produce intense citrus and floral character not seen anywhere else.  These heirloom varietals thrive at elevations up to 2,400 meters above sea level and the oxygen starvation produces dense small beans loaded with flavor.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eEthiopia utilizes central mills to process fresh cherries and it seems synonymous that quality of coffee is determined by good management practices at the washing stations. Fresh Cherry arrives daily and is immediately put through disc pulpers and pumped into large concrete washing tanks.  The cleanliness of these tanks will ultimately determine the cleanliness of the coffee.  The depulped mucilage coffee is put into these tanks with water for up to 48 hours where fermentation of the sugars begins to break down the pectin of the fruit.  Following the 48 hour soak, the drain at the bottom of these tanks is released, allowing the water and cherry to flow into large washing channels where it can be scrubbed clean, removing all sticky mucilage.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe last step of the processing is to dry the coffee on raised beds for a minimum of 8 days before being sent to the dry mill to remove parchment and separate according to size and quality of the coffee.  In ethiopia the top quality is simply deemed Grade 1.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eKochere is both the name of the of the district, as well as the particular mill where this coffee comes from.  This coffee immediately struck me as wildly different simply because of the size beans.  When we receive a sample of coffee, the first step is to measure the moisture, volatility through water activity and lastly the density of beans by just taking a 5 gram sample and seeing how many beans it takes to equal these five grams.  This helps to give an indication to how long the development of the coffee should need to be in order to fully develop sugars and yet allow balance of pleasant acids in the cup.  \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLighter mouthfeel with tight citric acidity and aromatic florals make this Kochere a coffee we are proud to offer. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e"

This seasonal offering will always be changing to reflect the seasonality of coffee growing regions at their peak of harvest.  Unlike a Florida orange however, there are many steps that a coffee must go through before it can be used.  This series of steps includes harvest, processing, milling, bagging, exporting, importing and lastly roasting.

Known for its rich stone fruit flavors and high peach like sweetness, Sidamo varies from its more popular neighbor Yirgacheffe that tend to be a bit more citrus and floral.  We really liked the sweetness and depth this coffee had as soon as we cupped it, but when we began pulling shots we got to see its full potential.  Due to the high elevation this coffee is grown at, it is very dense which allows more options in profile setting when it comes to both roasting as well as extracting this espresso.  We like this coffee because of its versatility in espresso, whether you are looking for a ristretto with denser sweetness, or a longer shot and extraction with acidity, this coffee has great potential.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e",

We start by sourcing coffees only for the purpose of roasting a little bit heavier. This means the coffees must be grown at a higher elevation in order to take longer roast times but maintain the acidity and complexity. While most of our coffees are drank black, this is the one coffee that we roast in a way designed to be great with milk in an espresso or even brewed with cream.\u003c\/p\u003e"
